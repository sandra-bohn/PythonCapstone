# PythonCapstone
These scripts were created for my CodingNomads Python development capstone course. The "fetch_tweets" scripts search Twitter for tweets containing a phrase, in this case "climate change", and store tweets in either a .json file or MySQL database. 
The "analyze_tweets" scripts analyze the stored tweets for various characteristics, such as average length and most common words and symbols found in the tweets. The json analysis script writes a summary of the analysis to a text file and the database analysis script stores the metrics in the database, indexed by the time when the analysis was completed.
